### Hi there! 👋

I am a Software Engineer with a focus on data and backend systems, combining hands-on experience in data engineering, backend development, and cloud-native architectures. I build reliable data pipelines, scalable backend services, and modern analytics solutions across AWS, GCP, Snowflake, and open-source technologies.

My work spans data engineering, backend development, cloud infrastructure, and internal developer tools, with growing interests in machine learning, web development, mobile applications, and software engineering best practices. I enjoy designing systems that are robust, maintainable, and built for scale whether processing millions of records, enabling real-time analytics, or delivering secure, high-performance applications for end users.
